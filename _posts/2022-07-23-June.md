Took gigas roslin proteins and blasted to swiss-prot

```
/home/shared/ncbi-blast-2.11.0+/bin/blastp \
-query ../genome-features/GCF_002022765.2_C_virginica-3.0_protein.faa \
-db ../blastdb/uniprot_sprot_r2022_02 \
-out ../output/17-Swiss-Prot-Annotation/Cvir_protein-uniprot_blastp.tab \
-evalue 1E-20 \
-num_threads 40 \
-max_target_seqs 1 \
-outfmt 6
```
