This is a running daily of all the stuff done in June.

**June 21**

Powere outage slows down early progress on raven.


Recalled that I had did some CEABIGR kallisto last week. Laura found some DEGs.

Next up is intersecting with DMLs with features and    
getting a count matrix for females in kallisto to hand off to Laura.

Trying epidiverse / snp

What a mess.

BS-SNPer not doing well with Oly v82 (100000k and bigger / 32 contigs). Not sure of issue.

**June 16**

Plan to look at Oly paper revisions and push ceabigr a bit.

Tried BS-snper Oly -> too many chromosomes.

Trying to tackle kallisto in ceabigr.; got it.

Ran the following to try to get conversion efficiency on Oly work

Talked with L & K
Will see if I can get BS snper on concat genome.

June 15

Today I finally got through the snip analysis with the Arnie sick data. A large problem was the standard out files were too big. I ended up just having to delete them because for some reason they cannot be added to the get ignore file. I posted the results of the filtered snaps search the time I get feedback on what the next step will be.
