When setting threshold to


```
# get hyper methylated bases (0 is male, 1 female)
myDiff_c75p.hyper=getMethylDiff(myDiff_c,difference=75,qvalue=0.01,type="hyper")
#
# get hypo methylated bases
myDiff_c75p.hypo=getMethylDiff(myDiff_c,difference=75,qvalue=0.01,type="hypo")
#
# get all differentially methylated bases
myDiff_c75p=getMethylDiff(myDiff_c,difference=75,qvalue=0.01)
```
