Exploring RNA-Seq data from Illumina effort

Here is what Sam sent

```
The 12 samples will be used for RNAseq for genome annotation – numbers indicate desired sequencing priority.

Juvenile and larval samples were from Hollie Putnam (see links below for more info).

Other tissue was from a single, adult geoduck, collected by Brent & Steven on 20150811.

Larvae day 5 (EPI_99)
Crystalline style
Byssus gland
