June 15

Today I finally got through the snip analysis with the Arnie sick data. A large problem was the standard out files were too big. I ended up just having to delete them because for some reason they cannot be added to the get ignore file. I posted the results of the filtered snaps search the time I get feedback on what the next step will be.
