We took DNA from a single Eastern oyster and prepped using MBD, MSP digestion, and plain old DNA. Full details can be found [here](http://onsnetwork.org/kubu4/2018/01/16/samples-submitted-c-virginica-gdna-mbd-and-mspi-to-qiagen/).


Five samples were sent to Qiagen for library prep and sequencing.
```
gDNA C.virginica – Genomic DNA, 20uL, 58.4ng/uL
MBD 1 virginica – Fragmented (~400bp average size), MBD-enriched, 25uL, 18.3ng/uL
MBD 2 virginica – Fragmented (~400bp average size), MBD-enriched, 25uL, 19.6ng/uL
MspI 1 virginica – gDNA digested with MspI, 25uL, 53.4ng/uL
MspI 2 virginica – gDNA digested with MspI, 25uL, 31.0ng/uL
```

From this, 20 preps were made.
